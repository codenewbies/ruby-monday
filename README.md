# Welcome to the Rub Monday Project! 
This repo is the project for the CodeNewbie Ruby Monday group that you can find here. To get started, read the following, and if you get stuck, reach out to @sarony the project faciliator.

### About this project
We are building a todo app as a community project to help us develop our ruby skills. In particular, we hope to work on:

- collabortion
- writing specs
- turn feature requirements into actual features!
- learn together
- get code reviewed

## Getting Started

### Tech requirements
You'll need to have installed ruby to begin. Here's how:

You'll also need a github account and some knowledge of git. If you're not comfortable using git, that's perfectly fine! Start by reading this article and taking this course. If you get stuck or would like to walk through it with a real person, send us a note here and we'd be happy to setup some time to do it together.

### Skill requirements
You're welcome to start contributing at any level, but it's helpful to have some Ruby basics down. If you havne't done so already, take the Ruby track on Codeacdemy first. And if you're up for it, try Learn Ruby The Hard Way too. The come back and get your code on!

### How to contribute
This project uses pull requests to make sure your code is looked at by others, and we have a truly collaborative system. Here's what to do:

- look through the issues list and pick a feature you want to work on
- clone repo
- etc.

## Community rules & guidelines
The purpose of this project is to learn by working on a real-world application.
