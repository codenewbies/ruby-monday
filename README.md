# Welcome to the Ruby Monday Project! 
This repo is the project for the CodeNewbie Ruby Monday group that you can find here. To get started, read the following, and if you get stuck, reach out to @sarony the project faciliator.

### About this project
We are building a todo app as a community project to help us develop our ruby skills. We'll meet weekly to review the project, review code together, and TK. In particular, we hope to work on:

- collabortion
- writing specs (only ruby?)
- turn feature requirements into actual features!
- learn together
- get code reviewed by community members

## Getting Started

### Tech requirements
You'll need to have installed [INSERT LANGUAGE HERE ] to begin. Here's how:

- rails setup (https://gorails.com/setup/)

- Mac
- Windows
- Linux

You'll also need a Github account and some knowledge of git. If you're not comfortable using git, that's perfectly fine! Start by looking at the following resources. 

- [Github For Beginners: Don't Get Scared, Get Started](http://readwrite.com/2013/09/30/understanding-github-a-journey-for-beginners-part-1)
An incredibly newbie-friendly introduction to the world of git and Github. Written by a non-developer, it's a great introduction to many of the popular concepts and terms in git. 

- [Github For Beginners: Commit, Push and Go](http://readwrite.com/2013/10/02/github-for-beginners-part-2)
Part two of the above article, this post takes you through setting up a git repo and performing common commands in your repo. Open up your terminal and follow along to get the most out of this post.

- [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1)
This course from Code School lets you try out git from the browser. It's an easy way to learn about and try the commands you'll use for the Ruby Monday project.

- [Feature Branch Workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/feature-branch-workflow)
We'll be using the Feature Branch Workflow for these projects. This is a great blog post filled with awesome diagrams that show you how it works. Once you've familiarized yourself with git and Github, read through this to see how we'll use it in this collaborative setting.

- *Have more git questions?* If you've gone through the posts above and want to walk through git concepts with a real person, send us a note (here)[mailto: "hello@codenewbie.org"] and we'd be happy to setup some time to do it together.

### Skill requirements
You're welcome to start contributing at any level, but it's helpful to have some Ruby and Rails basics down. If you haven't done so already, take the Ruby track on Codeacdemy first. And if you're up for it, try Learn Ruby The Hard Way too. The come back and get your code on!

This is post tutorials, real project time. Brace yourselves. Not sure if this is for you? Take a look at the issues and see if there's one you can start on.

### How to contribute
This project uses pull requests to make sure your code is looked at by others, and we have a truly collaborative system. Here's what to do:

- Join our [Slack community][1] and tell your host [ INSERT HOST HANDLE HERE ] you want to join the project repo
- accept invite from github to join as a collaborator
- look through the issues list and pick a feature you want to work on
- clone repo
- make a feature branch
- push branch and make PR
- copy and paste PR link to Slack channel for review
- once you get a thumbs up from a community member, merge to master & close branch

### Come to Ruby Monday!
Join us at 9PM EST on Monday to review code and talk about the project. Come with questions, TK, and TK.
