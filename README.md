# Welcome to the Rub Monday Project! 
This repo is the project for the CodeNewbie Ruby Monday group that you can find here. To get started, read the following, and if you get stuck, reach out to @sarony the project faciliator.

### About this project
We are building a todo app as a community project to help us develop our ruby skills. We'll meet weekly to review the project, review code together, and TK. In particular, we hope to work on:

- collabortion
- writing specs (only ruby?)
- turn feature requirements into actual features!
- learn together
- get code reviewed by community members

## Getting Started

### Tech requirements
You'll need to have installed ruby to begin. Here's how:

- rails setup (https://gorails.com/setup/)

- Mac
- Windows
- Linux

You'll also need a github account and some knowledge of git. If you're not comfortable using git, that's perfectly fine! Start by reading this article and taking this course. If you get stuck or would like to walk through it with a real person, send us a note here and we'd be happy to setup some time to do it together.

- try.github.io

Want to test your knowledge? Take our collaboration git quiz ()

### Skill requirements
You're welcome to start contributing at any level, but it's helpful to have some Ruby and Rails basics down. If you haven't done so already, take the Ruby track on Codeacdemy first. And if you're up for it, try Learn Ruby The Hard Way too. The come back and get your code on!

This is post tutorials, real project time. Brace yourselves. Not sure if this is for you? Take a look at the issues and see if there's one you can start on.

### How to contribute
This project uses pull requests to make sure your code is looked at by others, and we have a truly collaborative system. Here's what to do:

- Join our Slack community and tell your host you want to join the project
- accept invite from github to join as a collaborator
- look through the issues list and pick a feature you want to work on
- clone repo
- make a feature branch
- push branch and make PR
- copy and paste PR link to Slack channel for review
- once you get a thumbs up from a community member, merge to master & close branch

### Come to Ruby Monday!
Join us at 9PM EST on Monday to review code and talk about the project. Come with questions, TK, and TK.

## Community rules & guidelines
